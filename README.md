# I'm Miguel Figuera Quintero.

I'm a Web Developer that finished The Odin Project curriculum.
I did the rails path and now Im trying to end the Node.js Path too.

I am currently enrolled at the **_Universidad Nacional Experimental de las Telecomunicaciones e Inform√°tica_** (UNETI) on Venezuela. My goal is to pursue a comprehensive education and ultimately become a skilled Software Engineer.

You can contact me through [here by phone](https://wa.me/584241727988) or [using linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-quintero725/).

My set of tools are:

1. JS, NodeJs, React, Nextjs.
2. Ruby, Rails.
3. Python (for other stuff and not precisely webDevelopment).

If you do not desire to wander in my repos, you can check [my page](https://miguelfiguera.github.io/miguelfiguera/#contact) to see the best (told by me) projects that I have done
in the pass year.

You can think that I'm self taught, but I will have to say like Arnold (yeah, Schwarzenegger) that _there is no self-made man_ because I owe getting this far to a lot of people. Even my pets get some credit too.

You will find a lot of toy apps in my repositories, all of TOP or FreeCodeCamp.org, since I had too do some projects to earn the certifications.

I wish you well, fellow coder.

M.F.
