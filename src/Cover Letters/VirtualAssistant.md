## Dear Employer,

I graduated from college as a **Musician**, this may sound too far away from the virtual assistant branch, but in my case, part of the curriculum of the public college in my country (Venezuela) is to develop artistic-community projects. This gave me four and a half years of experience working as a manager, logistics, bookkeeping, teacher, community-assistant, and nurturing a growing aspect of a community creating a deep understanding and love for the arts where there was none.

Also, I'm a drummer, and my job as a musician is to create the atmosphere for the other players to sound as amazing as they can, I complement their work with my skills, and that is what I'm putting on the table: a professional that will work helping your clients to achieve their very best (normally doing a part of the heavy lifting).

Also, my experience as a musician gave me the tools to work with any kind of team under pressure or with enough time to deliver a plan for a project. This also taught me that you can achieve any goal or deadline with discipline, hard work, and a good understanding of the capabilities of the team members. Part of the philosophy of a jazz musician is that "music comes first" this extrapolates to any job I have done as my favorite guideline for teamwork.

### After College I worked as:

1. Virtual assistant for **Dash Venezuela entrepreneurs program** for two years, helping them to develop, teach, and support their community.
2. Logistics as an event planner for Dash Venezuela and for social media view.
3. Chief Operating Officer for **social media view**(RRSS company).
4. As an entrepreneur, being the virtual assistant of some colleagues, translating to Spanish and reviewing code.
5. As a music teacher, freelancing, online, and presential.

The covid pandemic made me reinvent myself and discover my remote skill set to carry on with all the work that I had as part of social media view and this lead me to find other opportunities to work remotely.

In addition to my skills, I really like to tackle new challenges and I would be very happy to work with your clients to help them achieve their business or personal goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I wish you well.

Sincerely,

### **Miguel Figuera.**
