Dear Employer,

I graduated from college as a Musician, this may sound too far away from the developer ecosystem, and it is. Becoming a developer was a self-taught journey most of the time. I had the help of some really extensive free resources like The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/ (where I took the Ruby on Rails path, React, Node.js, and Next.js) and Free Code Camp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/perrosaurio725 (where I centered my attention to JavaScript and Python).

Both of them gave me the content, but I had to earn all the knowledge with reading, practice, developing small toy projects up to big ones, and _walking the path_ as some say. I did this with only my will to learn.

My toolkit is composed of:

1. Ruby & Ruby on Rails
2. React
3. Vite & webpack.
4. git.
5. Javascript.
6. Next.JS
7. NodeJs
8. Html5
9. Css3
10. Bootstrap/Tailwind.
11. gitHub
12. Python (still learning).

This journey gave me the tools to understand how is usually the workflow of a developer, the way to tackle new unknown obstacles, and the resilience to keep up, because somewhere, on some web, someone has the answer even if I do not.

My experience as a musician gave me the tools to work with any kind of team under pressure or with enough time to deliver a plan for a project. This also taught me that you can achieve any goal or deadline with discipline, hard work, and a good understanding of the capabilities of the team members. Part of the philosophy of a jazz musician is that "music comes first" This extrapolates to any job I have done as my favorite guideline for teamwork.

I do not have any previous experience working as a developer for any company, I just have my projects and some freelance work done, but I am eager to learn and grow in this community. I like to tackle new challenges and I'm looking for opportunities to do it.'.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I wish you well.

Sincerely

Miguel Figuera
