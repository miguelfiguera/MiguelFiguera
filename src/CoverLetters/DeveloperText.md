### Dear Employer,

I graduated from college as a Musician, this may sound too far away from the developer ecosystem, and it is. Becoming a developer was a "kind of" self-taught journey most of the time. I had the help of some really extensive free resources like The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/ (where I took the Ruby on Rails path, React, Node.js, and Next.js) and Free Code Camp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/perrosaurio725 (where I centered my attention to JavaScript, Typescript and Python).

Both of them gave me the content, but I had to earn all the knowledge with reading, practice, developing small toy projects up to big ones, and _walking the path_ as some say. I did this with only my will to learn.

I am currently enrolled at the **_Universidad Nacional Experimental de las Telecomunicaciones e Inform√°tica_** (UNETI) on Venezuela. My goal is to pursue a comprehensive education and ultimately become a skilled Software Engineer.

#### My toolkit is composed of:

1. Ruby & Ruby on Rails
2. React
3. git.
4. Javascript.
5. Next.JS
6. NodeJs
7. Bootstrap/Tailwind/Material UI (FlowBite too).
8. GitHub
9. Python (still learning).
10. PostgreSQL
11. Firebase
12. Mongo DB
13. SQL

This journey gave me the tools to understand how is usually the workflow of a developer, the way to tackle new unknown obstacles, and the resilience to keep up, because somewhere, on some web, someone has the answer even if I do not.

My experience as a musician gave me the tools to work with any kind of team under pressure or with enough time to deliver a plan for a project. This also taught me that you can achieve any goal or deadline with discipline, hard work, and a good understanding of the capabilities of the team members. Part of the philosophy of a jazz musician is that "music comes first" This extrapolates to any job I have done as my favorite guideline for teamwork.

My previous experience is working as web developer for **AlphaComputer** and **Sistemas Globales ARC**, I'm currently employed on **Planet Solar Las Antillas** as an IT. Also I have some freelance work as a FullStack Developer on NextJS and Ruby on Rails. I am eager to learn and grow in this community. I like to tackle new challenges and I'm looking for opportunities to do it.'.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I wish you well.

Sincerely

### Miguel Figuera
